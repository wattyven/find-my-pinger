# 'Find My' Pinger

## Inspired by [\@wakapippi and \@aiueo4041](https://twitter.com/aiueo4041/status/1784813539833835550)

Put this together in a couple minutes on a whim after seeing that thread, so not exactly the cleanest code.

Relies on Python + Selenium, + a browser of your choice; I don't have Chrome installed, as I normally use Firefox, but the Find My page seems to have errors loading properly on Firefox, so I switched to Edge by default for this. Swap to Chrome if you'd like.
